# PortfolioWebsite

#DESCRIPTION

For my Final Project, I created a portfolio website. I chose to create a portfolio website so I can track my work and accomplishments.
It will make a great addition to my resume. During the process of creating this website, I learned three different coding languages.
I learned: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. These three languages helped me build and create my website. On my website, I have five different sections:
Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact.

#EXECUTING PROGRAM
To run this program, type in the addess bar: "https://techkailey.github.io/" or click the link.
This will direct you to the website.
However, when transferring the website with the link, it modifies a few things.
For example, the pictures and background color.
